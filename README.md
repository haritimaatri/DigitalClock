# DigitalClock
A digital clock is a type of clock that displays the time digitally (i.e. in numerals or other symbols), as opposed to an analogue clock. Digital clocks are often associated with electronic drives, but the "digital" description refers only to the display, not to the drive mechanism.


STEPS TO CREATE DIGITAL CLOCK USING HTML ,CSS,JS :
1. Set up your HTML structure.
2. Create the CSS file (style.css) to style the clock.
3. Add JavaScript code (index.js) to update the clock.
4. Save the files in the same directory (index.html, style.css, index.js).
5. Open the index.html file in a web browser, and you should see the digital clock displaying the current time. The clock will automatically update every second.
 That's it! You have created a simple digital clock using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
 
 NOTE : Feel free to modify the CSS styles to customize the clock's appearance
